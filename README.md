SNMPGetSet
==========

<p>This program was created for a Computer Networking class project. It utilizes <a href="http://www.snmp4j.org/" title="SNMP4J.org">SNMP4J</a> so that the program can access values associated with editable OID values. Eventually, MIB file handling will/should be added to increase functionality.</p>
